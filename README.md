#Analytics Dashboard

This project is using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to build a high powered analytics dashboard website using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library which is being hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Part of this project is based on a real commercial software project and it builds statistics by [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) mostly [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) from a software system.

Ruby instance variables are being used for each [HTML 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) page via the [instance_variable_get](http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/instance_variable_get) and [instance_variable_set](http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/instance_variable_set) built in Ruby custom functions.  

Another interesting technique that is being used is [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) to build all the HTML pages, which are then written to files.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) are being used for a [responsive desgined](https://responsivedesign.is/) mobile first website.
