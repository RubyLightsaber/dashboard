#Analytics Dashboard

This project is using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to build a high powered analytics dashboard website using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library which is being hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Part of this project is based on a real commercial software project and it builds statistics by [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) mostly [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) from a software system.  Most of the XML Schema for this project was hand created and the rest comes from the open source Ruby programming language.

Another interesting technique that is being used is [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) to build all the HTML pages, which are then written to files.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) are being used for a [responsive desgined](https://responsivedesign.is/) mobile first website.

Ruby instance variables are being used for each [HTML 5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) page via the [instance_variable_get](http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/instance_variable_get) and [instance_variable_set](http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/instance_variable_set) built in Ruby custom functions.  

[Ruby global variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_variables.htm) are being used for the width and height of each chart.

I am using [Cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to display statistics on the homepage and since this project has been developed  primarily on Windows you will need to add it to your Windows path.
